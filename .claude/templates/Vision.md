## Instructions for Claude Code

When working on this project:

1. **Always align with the vision** - Ensure suggestions support the core value proposition
2. **Prioritize by user impact** - Focus on features that deliver the most user value
3. **Respect constraints** - Work within stated technical and business limitations
4. **Consider trade-offs** - Use the decision framework when making recommendations
5. **Question scope creep** - Flag suggestions that might conflict with non-goals
6. **Measure against success criteria** - Ensure work contributes to defined success metrics

If you encounter conflicts between this vision and specific requirements, please highlight them and suggest alternatives that maintain alignment with the overall project direction.
